Not fully complete.

I have completed in creating a log-in and sign up.

Completed a POST, GET, and DELETE.

Failed in finishing the PUT and in created a log where only your data shows. I want to bring this into community to get it working.

Some of the difficulties I ran into was when I was trying to create a pop-up form to act as a PUT method form.

I will ask questions on community.
